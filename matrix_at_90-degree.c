/*
 Description:
 This program transposes a square matrix (3x3) by swapping elements across its main diagonal.
 The transposition converts rows into columns, effectively flipping the matrix along its diagonal.

 Key Learning:
 - When swapping elements in an array, you must avoid swapping elements twice.
   Similar to string reversal (where we swap only up to half the length),
   transposing a matrix requires careful traversal to prevent re-swapping.

 - In a square matrix, swapping happens between elements `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]`.
   To avoid redundant swaps, we only traverse the **upper triangle** (above the diagonal).
   Thatâ€™s why `j` starts from `i + 1`, ensuring that we don't swap elements back.

 ðŸ”¥ TIP: Avoid swapping elements twice in any problem by:
   1. Identifying which elements need swapping and marking them.
   2. Ensuring your traversal does not revisit swapped elements.
   3. Using two-pointer techniques or constraints like `j = i + 1` (as done here).
